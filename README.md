Inspired from Liang Tong's bargraph. Pygraph written in python 2.7.3 puts protein sequence information
(alignment, secondary structure prediction, disorder prediction, domain organization) into one graphics file. 

You need (at least 1): 
1. sequence alignment file: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/
2. seconday structure prediction file: http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/
3. Disorder prediction file: http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/?disopred=1
4. Domain organization: residue ranges
